Title of the Project:- Student Enrollment Form
Description:- In this project, I have made input Fields like Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date.
Also there are 3 buttons like Save,Update and Reset. The functionality of these buttons is like to save the data, if the data is already existed in the database, then as soon as user enters the rollno,data will be visible and update button will get enabled. So users can update data like this if they want to.


Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:-
JsonPowerDB is easy to use, development cost is minimum, more faster, minimize the complexity of interoperability of different applications.
Also it is technology futuristic as in it fills the gap from database to big data, plugable with new algorithms etc.
Finally, JsonPowerDB does carry maximum data processing performance as well.
